        <h3>About this example</h3>
        <p>
            We are using a custom template to remove the list with
            GraphQL definitions that used to be here.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a simple change because the about.html template doesn't include
            references to more templates, but some of them do. For example, index.html
            has references to all the other templates!
        </p>
        <p>
            You have to be careful including these same references in your custom
            templates to render the full page ðŸ‘€
